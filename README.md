# Essential UI

Essential UI is a small texturepack, that changes all buttons and the hotbar to fit the style of the Essential mod. With This texturepack, your Minecraft will look much cleaner when using the Essential mod.

## Hotbar

If you want to change the hotbar to the vanilla variant, you will have to go to the ressourcepack folder and exchange `assets/minecraft/textures/gui/widgets.png` for [this image](https://strassburger.org/img/essentialui/widgets.png).
